1. ES Setup
2. KIBANA Setup
3. Logstash Setup
4. Wazuh Setup
5. Filebeat in wazuh server Setup
6. Agent with wazuh agent

Objective of lab: PHASE I

Wazuh agent will send logs to wazuh manager
wazuh manager will store the log in archieve / wazuh alerts
This wazuh alert is by default parsed by wazuh decoders.. but just in case for future we need extra parsed value,
filebeat on the same machine will read the wazuh alerts logs and send it to logstash
logstash will have parser to further parse the logs
logstash will send the parsed logs to elasticsearch
now elasticseasrch has the alert data

kibana will visualize this data from elasticsearch - parsed data will be on wazuh-alerts\* index.
kibana will also have wazuh plugin to monitor wazuh agents, see wazuh alert logs, and much more.

Objective of lab: PHASE II

Secure everything: implement ssl/tls between each client and server
Authentication

Objective of lab: PHASE III

Better management of password in docker-compose in .env maybe
Refine every configuration in docker-compose as such no manual intervention is required.

Objective of lab: PHASE IV

Explore wazuh capabilities- - Detect malicious file and deletion. (Both linux and windows) - Malicious file download from browser, delete it. - SSH brute force (Both linux and windows)
